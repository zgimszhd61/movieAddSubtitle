1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Did it all get started? Take us back to when you really started all of this.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Well, that was the summer of 95. I had no money whatsoever.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I was working, doing research in Silicon Valley on a completely different subject

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and trying to start this company at the same time.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And when it came time to decide do I want to do graduate studies or do I want to start this company

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and I decided to start the company, I had no money.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
As a graduate student I would have received a scholarship and a stipend and so forth.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
In starting the company I had nothing. I had no income source.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So we found that an office was actually cheaper than an apartment in Silicon Valley.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So we got this dinky little office that had a leaky roof.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It was just the nastiest place you can imagine.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And you lived in it too?

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And I lived in it too and showered at the YMCA.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This lasted for about three or four months.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And the reason we chose this office in addition to it being really cheap

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
was that there was an internet service provider on the floor below.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So we were able to get really cheap internet access by drilling a hole in the floor

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and connecting to their server directly.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You know, this industry is so young and we don't really know where it's going.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But what do you see as the future of the internet?

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I think the internet is the superset of all media.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It is the be all and end all of media.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
One will see print, broadcast, arguably radio,

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
essentially all media folding into the internet.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And what the internet amounts to is it's the first two-way communication medium

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
that is intelligent.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It allows consumers to choose what they want to see, when they want to see it,

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and whether that be radio, whether that be print, whether that be television broadcast.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I think it's going to revolutionize all traditional media.
